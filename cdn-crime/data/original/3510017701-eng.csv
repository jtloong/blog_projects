..  : not available for a specific reference period,

Footnotes:
1,"For the period from 1998 to 2017 Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents."
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services."
3,"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003. Starting in 1996, the populations for CMAs have been adjusted to reflect the actual policing boundaries within the CMA and do not reflect the official Statistics Canada population for these CMAs. CMA data are included within province-level data."
4,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident."
5,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Saint John for 2005 to 2011 and for Winnipeg for 2011. Crime data for these years for these respondents have therefore been revised."
6,"Populations at the census metropolitan areas (CMA) level by age and sex are not available prior to 2004, and as a result, rates for adults and youth are not available for these years."
7,"Part of the 2007 increase in crime in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and Saint John, New Brunswick can be attributed to changes in police reporting practices rather than actual increases in criminal activity."
8,"In 2012, Charlottetown altered the classification of calls from the public regarding impaired driving which accounts for the decrease at the municipal and provincial levels that year."
9,"Abbotsford-Mission, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario became new census metropolitan areas (CMAs) as of the 2001 Census. Moncton, New Brunswick, Peterborough, Ontario, Brantford, Ontario, Guelph, Ontario, Barrie, Ontario, and Kelowna, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2006 Census."
10,"Part way through 2013, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police revised policing boundaries for rural detachments in New Brunswick. This resulted in a change in the census metropolitan area (CMA) boundaries that are determined for the purpose of reporting crime statistics. As such, 2013 data for the New Brunswick CMAs of Saint John and Moncton are not comparable to previous or future years. Further, data from 2014 onward are not comparable to years prior to 2014."
11,"In 2018, Saint John Municipal Police Service identified a data processing issue that affected certain violations including: sexual assault (1310, 1320, 1330), assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm (1420), failure to appear (3510), failure to comply with order (3410) and breach of probation (3520). As such, estimations were applied for 2016 and 2017. Data should therefore be used with caution."
12,The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Saguenay was formerly known as Chicoutimi-Jonquière.
13,"With the release of 2013 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2011. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Saguenay. Crime data for these years for this respondent have therefore been revised."
14,The 2009 Sherbrooke clearance rate is exceptionally high because of dedicated efforts throughout the year to update the database before a major conversion in informatics.
15,"Data for Sherbrooke were not available in 2010, and therefore have been copied over from 2009 at the request of the police service."
16,"Clearance data for Montreal were not available in 2010, and therefore have been estimated based on clearance information from previous years."
17,"In 2012, it was discovered that the Montreal Police Service had been incorrectly applying the agreed upon definition for reporting child pornography incidents to the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). As such, the number of violations has been revised for the years 2008 to 2011."
18,"As a result of terrorist scares arising during the student demonstrations in the Spring of 2012 in Quebec, the Directeur des poursuites criminelles et pénales du Québec authorized police to make arrests under terrorism laws, particularly for 'hoax terrorism'. Therefore, the increase in terrorism-related incidents is mostly attributable to events related to the student demonstrations."
19,"In 2016, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment in Montréal underwent an exercise in making corrective measures to address under-counting of incidents importation/exportation and trafficking of drug offences. In response, Statistics Canada applied estimates to the 2015 revised data. As a result, numbers and rates from 2015 onwards should not be compared to data prior to 2015."
20,The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau was formerly known as Ottawa-Hull.
21,"The increase in failure to stop or remain in 2014 for Gatineau Police Service (24216) can be attributed to a change in charging practices within the police service. Rather than using provincial statutes, they are now charging these incidents based on Criminal Code provisions. Therefore, comparisons with previous years should not be made."
22,"Ottawa numbers also include child pornography incidents reported by the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which is located in the City of Ottawa. The Centre responds to internet-facilitated sexual abuse cases nationally. Therefore, while the incidents are detected by the RCMP Centre located in Ottawa and appear in Ottawa's crime statistics, the incidents themselves or the offenders are not limited to the city of Ottawa."
23,"Prior to 2013, all incidents of child pornography recorded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Service's Canadian Police Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (CPCMEC), located in Ottawa, were reported under the Ottawa Police Service. In 2014, Statistics Canada began reporting CPCMEC data separately and revised data for 2013 to account for this change. As a result of revisions to the 2013 data, some incidents identified by the CPCMEC and referred to the Ottawa Police Service for investigation may have been transferred to the CPCMEC. As such, the revised number of incidents for Ottawa Police Service for 2013 may be underrepresented and should not be compared to other years."
24,"In 2009, slight changes were made to the respondent-to-CMA mapping for this census metropolitan area (CMA) which have resulted in minor revisions to previously published data."
25,"Previous to 2014, Greater Sudbury (35290) would record only those incidents where a search warrant was obtained and a charge related to child pornography was laid. As of 2014, reporting practices have changed to include all information of IP addresses with links to child pornography for information gathering and intelligence purposes. Therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution."
26,Crime data from April to December 2004 for Winnipeg are estimates (except for homicide and motor vehicle theft) due to the implementation of a new records management system. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years.
27,"Approximately half of the vehicle thefts in Winnipeg in 2007 were attempts, higher than the national average of about 15%. Both the decrease in the number of completed vehicle thefts in Winnipeg, as well as the increase in attempted thefts, may be attributed to the new provincial requirement for specific high-risk vehicles to be equipped with immobilizers, rendering these vehicles much more difficult to steal."
28,"Youth crime in British Columbia may be somewhat undercounted due to the Crown charge-approval system in place whereby, even for minor offences, there must be approval by the Crown before charges are laid after police have made an arrest. This approval is based on the substantial likelihood of conviction."
29,"Data for 2001 include estimates for 3 months for the Vancouver police service and 2 months for the Port Moody police service, covering the phase-in period required for a new records management system. In addition, from September 2000 to September 2001, as a result of labour action, there were decreases in the number of crimes reported to the Vancouver police service for certain offences. As a result, the number of Criminal Code offences reported by Vancouver were affected during this period."
30,"As a result of ongoing investigations in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, there were 5 homicides reported in the Vancouver census metropolitan area (CMA) total for 2007, 5 reported in 2004, 7 reported in 2003 and 15 included in 2002 that occurred in previous years. Homicides are counted according to the year in which police file the report."
31,"In 2004, Vancouver police service changed their scoring procedures for reporting impaired driving incidents to include all incidents of impaired driving, not just those resulting in a charge being laid, meaning that incidents cleared by other means, (for example, roadside suspension) are now included. This resulted in almost 1,900 additional incidents being reported in 2004 compared to 2003. Use with caution when comparing these data with prior years."
32,"Between April 1 and September 30 2014, the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit (BC ICE) undertook a proactive project to record Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. This resulted in an increase in reported child pornography violations that year and all incidents detected by the BC ICE unit were recorded in the records management system used by Surrey Police Service. Therefore, while the incidents were reported through Surrey and appear in crime statistics for Surrey (and the Vancouver census metropolitan area [CMA] as Surrey is within this CMA's boundaries), neither the incidents themselves nor the offenders are limited to Surrey."
33,"The increase in incidents of child pornography between 2015 and 2016 in Vancouver can be in part attributed to a proactive project initiated by the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit which recorded Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that were in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. As the initiative focused on Vancouver in 2016, notable increases in these offences were reported by this jurisdiction. As a result, comparison with previous years should be done with caution."
34,"The increase in incidents of child pornography between 2014 and 2015 can be in part attributed to a proactive project initiated by the British Columbia Integrated Child Exploitation Unit which recorded Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that were in possession of, and possibly sharing child pornography. As the initiative focused on Victoria in 2015, notable increases in these offences were reported by this jurisdiction."
35,"1998 data in this table for Northwest Territories also includes Nunavut. In 1999, Nunavut, which comprises the eastern part of the old Northwest Territories, officially became a Canadian territory. Starting in 1999, data are displayed separately for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
